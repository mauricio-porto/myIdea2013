Abstract (Max 7000 chars)
--------

	A navigation system needs to know the current position of the person and the position of the desired destination. The majority of outdoor navigation systems are based on GPS to obtain positioning information. However the GPS does not have good reception inside buildings due to the attenuation and dispersion of the signals. In the existing indoor navigation systems, the position is usually determined with the aid of a network of existing RF devices, such as WiFi routers and RFID readers. For most cases where such infrastructure does not exist, such installation in order to allow the position detection is very expensive, making them unfeasible.

	Here is proposed an inexpensive indoor navigation system whose determination of position of both, the person and of the possible destinations, is done by reading NFC tags whose geographic coordinates were previously determined and stored in themselves. Once the person touches the tag with her NFC reader (smartphone, for example), her position can be accurately determined, making it possible to then establish the trajectory navigation to your destination or even other interim tags that comprise the final trajectory.
